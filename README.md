# WhatDoesItMean

This is a simple chrome extension I made that let's you translate words.

## Why is this amazing extension not live you might say?
Since I am a poor student and translating words is pricey.  



### Server

Create config.js in src/config
 and add following with your api key
```javascript
module.exports = {
    API_KEY: 'example_api_key'
}
```
Install and start the server

    npm install
    npm start
